      <h2>List Empty Reasons</h2>
      <p>General reasons for a list to be empty. Reasons are either related to a summary list (i.e. problem or medication list) or to a workflow related list (i.e. consultation list).</p>
      <p>This value set has an inline code system http://hl7.org/fhir/list-empty-reason, which defines the following codes:</p>

          <td>Clinical judgment that there are no known items for this list after reasonable investigation. Note that this a positive statement by a clinical user, and not a default position asserted by a computer system in the lack of other information. Example uses:  * For allergies: the patient or patient&#39;s agent/guardian has asserted that he/she is not aware of any allergies (NKA - nil known allergies)  * For medications: the patient or patient&#39;s agent/guardian has asserted that the patient is known to be taking no medications  * For diagnoses, problems and procedures: the patient or patient&#39;s agent/guardian has asserted that there is no known event to record.</td>
